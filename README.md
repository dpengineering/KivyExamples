# KivyExamples
A repository full of various Kivy Examples

Each folder has its own example and can be executed with python3. Just ensure
you have Kivy installed for the version of python3 you are using.

Take a look at `requirements.txt` to see the pip packages (with version numbers) that were used to create these examples. 
You can take a look at your packages and version numbers using `pip freeze` in your terminal. Make sure to type that command
after you have activated your Kivy virtual environment if that is applicable.
